Welcome to **LastCent Financial** — the premier (*fictional*) banking experience for those of us who are spiritually rich but financially... aspirational.

## 🚀 About the Project

This is a Java-based parody banking app designed for fun, learning, and the occasional existential crisis about your finances.

### What you can do:

- 💰 **Create accounts** with imaginary funds  
- 🏦 **Manage balances** that never existed  
- 📉 **Simulate transactions** that teach you why real banks say *"Insufficient Funds"*  
- 🤖 **Pretend you have customers** (they’re imaginary, too!)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is a **satirical project**.  
Please don’t attempt to buy coffee, crypto, or rent using this app.  
You *will* stay broke. Possibly **more** broke.
