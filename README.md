#💸 LastCent Financial — Because You Deserve What's Left
Welcome to LastCent Financial, the premier (fictional) banking experience for those of us who are spiritually rich but financially... aspirational.

This Java-based banking app lets you:

💰 Create accounts with imaginary funds

🏦 Manage balances that never existed

📉 Simulate transactions that remind you why real banks say "Insufficient Funds"

🤖 Pretend you have customers!

Built for fun, learning, and a deep existential reflection on why your wallet is lighter than your codebase.

Disclaimer: This is a parody project. Please don’t try to buy coffee using this app. You will stay broke. Possibly more broke.
